# Code README

This repository contains a collection of Python functions that perform various tasks. Each function is described below:

## linear_sum(x, result)

This function takes a list `x` and a target value `result`. It recursively calculates the sum of all possible combinations of the elements in `x` and checks if any of the sums equal the `result`. The function returns `True` if such a sum exists, and `False` otherwise.

## ordered_subset(str1, str2)

This function checks if `str2` is an ordered subset of `str1`. It recursively compares the characters of `str1` and `str2` to determine if `str2` is a subset of `str1` in the same order. The function returns `True` if `str2` is an ordered subset of `str1`, and `False` otherwise.

## k_size_subsets(n, k)

This function generates all possible subsets of size `k` from a set of integers from 1 to `n`. It uses recursion to find all combinations of the numbers and returns a list of the generated subsets.

## dict_depth(d)

This function calculates the depth of a nested dictionary `d`. It recursively traverses the dictionary and counts the number of nested levels. The function returns the maximum depth found in the dictionary.

## nested_get(d, key)

This function retrieves all the values associated with a given key in a nested dictionary `d`. It recursively searches through the dictionary and returns a list of all matching values.

## distance(row1, col1, row2, col2)

This function calculates the Manhattan distance between two points on a 2D grid. It takes the row and column coordinates of two points and returns the distance between them.

## add_tower(board, d, row, col)

This function adds a tower to a chessboard represented by the list `board`. The tower is placed at the specified `row` and `col` coordinates, and the function checks if the tower meets the distance requirement `d` from all previously placed towers. If the tower satisfies the distance condition, it is added to the board, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the tower is not added, and the function returns `False`.

## n_towers(n, d)

This function finds a configuration of `n` towers on an `n x n` chessboard, such that the towers satisfy the distance requirement `d`. It uses recursion and backtracking to explore all possible tower placements and returns a list representing the final configuration of towers on the board. If no valid configuration is found, an empty list is returned.
